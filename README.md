# Stools
Personal Toolbox for Python

Stools.py is a personal messy file with many functions that I often use.
It is composed of self coded things and things taken from around the web.
Credit should be attributed in the latter case.

FdF_Fpardo_China.py is a file defining the Fdf class use to calculate the value of a function and its derivative at the same position. It is adapted from the work of Fabrice Pardo (fabrice.pardo@c2n.upsaclay.fr). His FdF native algorithm is available on github.
